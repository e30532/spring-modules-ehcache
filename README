Spring Modules EHCache
----------------------
A version of spring-module-cache that works only with EHCache. 

This was a result of the dependency soup that is the current state of the
spring-modules-cache project. This is not meant to belittle or insult the work
done on that project, rather to get this code working, particularly the
spring-configuration cache tags, with minimal dependencies. 

The version of EHCache supported is 1.7.2.
